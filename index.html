    <p>Hi! My name is Linet Oliech. I am an upcoming software developer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I am
        currently learning software Engineering at Moringa School and I am
        enjoying it. I look forward to increase my skills and create beautiful
        websites. In my free time I like to read books and paint.
